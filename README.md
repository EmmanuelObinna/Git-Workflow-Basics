A struggle that I had was trying to figure out how to push and pull data. Also using VSCode for this was a little confusing at first but I eventually got it down.

A struggle I had while working this was just getting my SSH key/agent set up and added to my settings. Other than that, everything else was simple. I overcame this challenge by working with my group members and asking Professor Gering for a little help

Honestly the only struggle that I had was setting up the SSH key i was encountering a lot of problems along the way when setting it up. I had to lean on the internet and do a lot of looking up solutions. When I had that figured out though, it was somewhat easy to to add the rest of the other files.
